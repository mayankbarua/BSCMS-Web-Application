# Blood Supply Chain Management System  :

## Description : 
* The shortage of blood can occur at anytime, anywhere. Given the unpredictability of an emergency, one is quite unprepared no matter how cautious. As blood cannot be manufactured, and the shelf life of blood is too short, nothing could be said about the availability of a certain blood type in a particular healthcare facility. This makes human lives highly vulnerable despite the high technology era we live in. By proposing this application, we aim to simplify and automate the process of searching for blood in emergency situations. By maintaining a record of blood donors, recipients and stock availability in the blood bank, we plan to bring a sense of reliability in the decisions an individual makes, when time is of utmost value.

## User Stories following agile methodology: 

## Blood Bank:
1. As a blood bank manager, I should be able to login to the system by providing credentials and should be able to view the information of donor, recipient, and blood inventory.
1. As a blood bank manager, I should be able to update information related to blood bank or hospital.
1. As a blood bank manager, I should be able to search for a blood type based on the location,using pin code.
1. As a blood bank manager, I should be able to view blood inventory information.


## User Role:
1. As a user, I should be able to login to the system by providing the following information:Name, Gender, Date of birth, Address, city, zip code, email address, Phone no, username, and password.
1. A user should be able to make a blood donation appointment with the blood banks.
1. A user should be able to search the donors/blood banks based on the zip code. Once the user selects a donor/ blood bank the name of the donor should be displayed and when the user selects the donor/blood bank, he should be able to request the blood from that donor/ blood bank.
1. A user should be able to send a request to the donor/blood bank to receive blood, and the notification will be sent via email.
